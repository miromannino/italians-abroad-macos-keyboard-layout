Italians Abroad - MacOS Keyboard Layout
=====================================

Do you use a English keyboard but you want to write in Italian? Here is a custom keyboard for easily writing accented letters.

## Keys

The changes from the standard layouts only affect accented letters:

`alt + a` = à

`alt + e` = è

`alt + shift + e` = é

`alt + i` = ì

`alt + o` = ò

`alt + u` = ù

## Install

Copy `Italians Abroad - British.keylayout` and `Italians Abroad - US.keylayout` to your `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` folder.
Log out, restart, and then active one of them from `System Preferences → Keyboard → Input Sources`. These layouts can be find in the `Others` section.
