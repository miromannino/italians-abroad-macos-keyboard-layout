Italians Abroad - OSX Keyboard Layout
=====================================

For Italians abroad, mostly geeks who know that U.S. and UK keyboards are good for programming, but who also don't want to loose faith trying to quickly write a note in Italian using accented letters.

## Install

Copy `Italians Abroad - British.keylayout` and `Italians Abroad - US.keylayout` to your `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` folder.
Log out, restart, and then active one of them from `System Preferences → Keyboard → Input Sources`. These layouts can be find in the `Others` section.
